# 📁 Preload Documentation

Welcome to the **Preload Documentation Folder**! 🎉  
This folder contains detailed documentation for all the utilities, APIs, and internal tools designed to run inside the **Preload context** of an Electron app.

These modules are specifically built to handle communication between the renderer and the main process, window management, IPC requests, notifications, and UI helpers.
